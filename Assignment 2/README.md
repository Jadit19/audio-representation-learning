# Assignment 2

1. Given an audio file, use python to plot:

   - The waveform $x(t)$
   - Spectrogram $|X(f,t)|$, as a function of window size (in $s$), hop length (in $s$), $N$, etc
   - Spectrum $|X(f)|$, as a function of start time, $N$, etc

2. Make sounds such as aa, ee, o, u, etc. and study the characteristic fratures of their spectra / spectrograms
3. Make sounds such as t (as in tiwari), th (as in ratha), t (as in topi), th (as in neelkantha), and study the characteristic features of their spectra/spectrograms.
4. See the effect of using dB scale and mel-scale on spectra/spectrograms.
